Powershell toolkit for Emby media servers, torrent RSS feed parsing, and uTorrent management

Pre-built module binaries can be found in each module folder's ~/bin/github directory.  Copy to a folder of the same name in C:\Program Files\WindowsPowershell\Modules to make available for the Import-Module command.

More info will be coming soon, but for now my thanks to whomever wrote the uTorrentAPI.dll file included in this project, without which the torrent management would be nigh-impossible.  I've been using it personally for years, but if anyone can find the credits, I will be more than happy to give credit where it is due to this wonderful developer.
